# RAGI (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Inscribe)


![RAGI Logo](attachment:docs/ragi.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to RAGI, a nimble framework developed to expedite the iteration, development, and deployment of cognitive-centric bots, agents, or models. At the core of RAGI lies the innovative use of LangChain, enabling fluid interaction with an array of public LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Claude, alongside tailored models. Our framework excels at leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to imbue LLM outputs with targeted, contemporary information, enriching the responses without altering the original model. This approach ensures delivery of contextually accurate and current insights, particularly beneficial in sectors like finance where decision-making is paramount.

## Toward a Cognitive Architecture

RAGI is not just about processing information—it's about creating a system that emulates human cognition. We're building towards an architecture that understands, learns, and reasons, bringing a new level of intelligence to automated decision-making.

## Demo

Witness RAGI's capabilities through our prototype chat agent that utilizes the framework to:
- Accept and parse documents.
- Persist document data into FAISS Vector DB.
- Generate specialized prompts for risk analysis.
- Maintain conversational context with chat history.
- Engage interactively with users about their documents.

## Key Features

RAGI is designed to free engineers to focus on delivering customer value, enriched by a suite of sophisticated AI tools:

- **Extensible Hooks**: Our use of LangChain from the outset means quick starts and a standardized approach to model deployment and tooling integration. These hooks enable growth and new feature integration as requirements evolve.
- **Chat History**: Maintains conversation context for coherent and pertinent dialogue.
- **Vector Store for Document Vectors**: A repository for document vectors to support advanced semantic search and clustering.
- **Document Handler**: Processes documents in real-time, extracting vital information from diverse text sources.
- **LLM Wrapper**: A versatile wrapper for various LLMs, broadening the scope of applications and customization.
- **Config Module**: Manages transitions between development and production settings smoothly.
- **Prompt Explorer**: Enhances prompt crafting for effective LLM interaction.
- **SQL Worker**: Adds database-driven context to searches.
- **WandB Integration and Feedback Loop**: Inclusion of WandB provides a feedback loop for model tracing and deployment insights.
