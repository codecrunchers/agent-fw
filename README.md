![RAGI Logo](./docs/ragi_250.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to RAGI, a nimble framework developed to expedite the iteration, development, and deployment of cognitive-centric bots, agents, or models. At the core of RAGI lies the innovative use of LangChain, enabling fluid interaction with an array of public LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Claude, alongside tailored models. Our framework excels at leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to imbue LLM outputs with targeted, contemporary information, enriching the responses without altering the original model. This approach ensures delivery of contextually accurate and current insights, particularly beneficial in sectors like finance where decision-making is paramount.

## Toward a Cognitive Architecture

RAGI is not just about processing informationâ€”it's about creating a system that emulates human cognition. We're building towards an architecture that understands, learns, and reasons, bringing a new level of intelligence to automated decision-making.

## Demo

Witness RAG's capabilities through our prototype chat agent that utilizes the framework to:
- Accept and parse documents.
- Persist document data into FAISS Vector DB.
- Generate specialized prompts for risk analysis.
- Maintain conversational context with chat history.
- Engage interactively with users about their documents.
